Commandroid: Command Prompt Terminal Widget for Android (Xamarin.Android)

Commandroid is an open-source command prompt terminal widget designed for Android, built using Xamarin.Android. This is my first android project, it demonstrates how to make use of the AppWidgetProvider class, populating a listview while working within the context of RemoteViews, and the communication between these classes using BroadCast Receivers. It also makes use of the new Google Splash Screen API, and demonstrates the implementation of that.

Once installed you can add the Widget to your home screen by long pressing your homescreen, and tapping Widgets. From there you can long press CommAndroid, and drop it anywhere onto your home screen. I reccommend using the command 'help' to start.
